Model Isinga 2D

Instruction:
 1. Clone repository 
 2. ./a.out - program will run for 50 000 MonteCarlo Steps and temperature set to 1
 3. ./a.out {montecarloSteps} {temperature} - set MCSs and temp
 
 Need -std=gnu++11 flag to compile
 
 Program will output .txt file named wykres_{temperature}.txt which contains magnetic field statuses (?) counted per 10 MC steps
